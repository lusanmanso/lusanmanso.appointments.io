The purpose of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive clinical consultation service by creating a system for scheduling appointments across multiple clinics. The project is intended to simulate a networked environment that integrates a distributed computing architecture, enabling seamless communication between system components.

The backend is powered by *MySQL*, a relational database management system chosen for its robustness and ability to handle structured data efficiently. Communication between the frontend and backend is facilitated using *Java RMI* _(Remote Method Invocation)_, which ensures reliable and efficient interactions within the distributed system. This architecture supports core functionalities such as #underline[user registration], #underline[appointment booking], #underline[cancellation], and #underline[listing], thereby catering to essential administrative needs of clinical management.

The system is designed with extensibility in mind. To ensure modularity and adherence to the project's standards, the project adopts a layered architecture, separating concerns between the frontend, backend, and database layers.

Despite the progress achieved, certain features were not implemented within the scope of this project. Specifically, the implementation of *RESTful Web Services*, which are widely recognized as the standard for developing scalable and stateless APIs, #highlight[remains incomplete]. This omission is primarily attributed to the constraints of time and the challenges faced in undertaking this endeavor as a solo effort. Furthermore, the mechanisms for ^*user authentication and registration are not managed by the frontend* as stipulated in the original project specifications. Instead, a backend-managed approach was adopted to ensure a basic level of security, albeit deviating from the initially proposed architecture. 

These limitations are acknowledged, yet they represent opportunities for future enhancements, building upon the foundational work established in this project.
